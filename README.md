# Sketchpad HTS Plugin

This was created to provide an example
for how a plugin should be made for enchant97's 'Home Terminal System' program.
However it is fully functional as a basic sketch plugin.

It will be updated when the HTS is also updated with any major changes.

plugin requires HTS version >=3.5.5
